                <h3><u>Front-End</u></h3>
                <p>The front-end developer is responsible for creating the look, feel, and interactive components of a website. They are often mistaken as the only role in web development as well as confused with the role of a web designer. How text, images, and colors are displayed on a website when you view them on a phone, tablet, or computer is what the front-end developer creates. Ever see a button change color when you hover over it or a popup appear when you click on something on a page? That’s what the front-end developer creates. They make sure everything you see is organized, aesthetically pleasing, and functional.</p>

                <h3><u>Back-End</u></h3>
                <p>The back-end developer has one of the most crucial roles in web development. They create and maintain what’s under the hood to keep your website running and functioning properly. A back-end developer writes what is called server-side code to make sure data flows back and forth from a website’s front-end (what the user sees and interacts with) to the back-end (the server, database etc.). The best example of this would be an online store. Prices and product images are stored on a database hosted on a server. When it comes time to update prices or initiate an automated holiday sale, product information and prices are updated on the database which then displays on the website. When you checkout and process a transaction, all that works because the back-end developer madeit so. They write the code that makes all those easy to use (most of the time) functions possible.</p>

                <h3><u>Full-Stack</u></h3>
                <p> The full-stack developer is a unique developer type as they can program and work on both front-end and back-end parts of a website. They can literally create an entire functioning, dynamic website themselves (if they choose) as they understand both ends of web development. Full-stack developers tend to have prowess in coding in multiple programming languages and their knowledge and experience tend to be a mile-wide. Because of this, they generally work well with both the front-end and back-end developer during the development process.</p>
